2014-06-23 pearz <chambeg> adamhamo, I just didn't expect US to get anywhere. For me it's like watching to trains collide head on and then find the train engineer crawling out of the cab, trying to get to safety after the wreck even though he's lost both legs. You know he shouldn't even be alive and will, in all likelyhood, die, but you can't help but be interested and watch to see how far he gets.
2014-06-23 levinea <levinea>I'm the turing test!
